Spring Boot Data JPA Example Project
This project demonstrates how to integrate Spring Boot with Spring Data JPA for building robust and scalable database-driven applications.
It covers:

CRUD operations using Spring Data JPA Repositories

Entity mapping with Hibernate (JPA implementation)

Use of @Entity, @OneToOne, @OneToMany, and @ManyToMany relationships

Custom finder methods and @Query annotations

Integration with an H2/MySQL/PostgreSQL database

Proper exception handling with ResponseEntity

Use of application.properties for database configuration

Testing with Postman

This repo is a great starting point for understanding how to connect Spring Boot applications to relational databases using JPA while keeping the code clean, maintainable, and production-ready.
